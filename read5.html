                <li> Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
                    convey the mood and evokes reactions.</li>
                <li>There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
                    RGB values, hex codes, and color names.</li>
                <li>Color pickers can help you find the color you want.</li>
                <li>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
                    between any text and the background color (otherwise
                    people will not be able to read your content).</li>
                <li>CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
                    indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.</li>
                <li>CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
                    with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.</li>
            </ol>
