            A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF
            INSTRUCTIONS
            A script is a series of instructions that a
            computer can follow to achieve a goal.
            To write a script, you need to first
            state your goal and then list the
            tasks that need to be completed in
            order to achieve it.
            <ul>
                <li> DEFINE THE GOAL</li>
                <li> DESIGN THE SCRIPT </li>
                <li> CODE EACH STEP </li>
            </ul>
            Start with the big picture of what
            you want to achieve, and break
            that down into smaller steps.
            Once you know the goal, you can work out the tasks
            that can be represented usind a flowchart.

            then list some steps.
            <h2>EXPRESSIONS </h2>
            An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
            there are two types of expressions.
            <ul>
                <li>EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
                    VALUE TO A VARIABLE var color = 'beige'; </li>
                <li>EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
                    MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
                    SINGLE VALUE var area = 3 * 2; </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>OPERATORS
            </h2>
            Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
            create a single value from one or more values.
            <h2>
                STRING OPERATOR
            </h2>
            There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
            It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
            var firstName = 'Ivy ' ;
            var lastName = ' Stone' ;
            var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ;
            <h2>WHAT IS A FUNCTION? </h2>
            Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
