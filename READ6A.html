    <h1>CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT </h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>
        JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
        need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
        HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.
        If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
        the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
        because the script works with the model of the web
        page that the browser has created.
    <h2>LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE</h2>
    When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
    script element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
        Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
        opening script and closing </script> tags
            (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).
            <h2>STATEMENTS </h2>
            A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
            Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
            Statements should end with a semicolon.
            <ol>
                <li>STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND
                    EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE:
                    A statement is an individual instruction that the
                    computer should follow. Each one should start on a
                    new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your
                    code easier to read and follow. </li>
                <li>STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED
                    INTO CODE BLOCKS:
                    Some statements are surrounded by curly braces;
                    these are known as code blocks. The closing curly
                    brace is not followed by a semicolon. </li>

            </ol>
            <h2>COMMENTS </h2>
            You should write comments to explain what your code does.
            They help make your code easier to read and understand.
            This can help you and others who read your code.

            // Create a ne1~ dat e object
            </br>
            <ol>
                <li>MULTI-LINE COMMENTS: To write a comment that stretches over more than
                    one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
                    the /* characters and ending with the */ characters.
                    Anything between these characters is not processedÂ·
                    by the JavaScript interpreter.

                </li>
                <li>SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS:
                    In a single-line comment, anything that follows the
                    two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not
                    be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Singleline comments are often used for short
                    descriptions
                    of what the code is doing.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>A VARIABLE</h2>
            A script will have to temporarily
            store the bits of information it
            needs to do its job. It can store this
            data in variables.

            <h2>DATA TYPES </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>NUMERIC DATA TYPE</li>
                <li>STRING DATA TYPE

                <li>BOOLEAN DATA TYPE </li>
                </ol>
             <h2>RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES</h2>
                <li>The name must begin with
                    a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
                    underscore (_). It must not start
                    with a number.</li>

                <li>All variables are case sensitive,
                    so score and Score would be
                    different variable names, but
                    it is bad practice to create two
                    variables that have the same
                    name using different cases.</li>
               
                <li>The name can contain letters,
                    numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
                    underscore (_). Note that you
                    must not use a dash(-) or a
                    period (.) in a variable name.</li>
                
                <li>Use a name that describes the
                    kind of information that the
                    variable stores. For example,
                    fi rstName might be used to
                    store a person's first name,
                    l astNarne for their last name,
                    and age for their age.</li>
                
                <li>You cannot use keywords or
                    reserved words. Keywords
                    are special words that tell the
                    interpreter to do something. For
                    example, var is a keyword used
                    to declare a variable. Reserved
                    words are ones that may be used
                    in a future version of JavaScript.

                    reserved words in JavaScript.</li>
                
                <li>If your variable name is made
                    up of more than one word, use a
                    capital letter for the first letter of
                    every word after the first word.
                    For example, f i rstName rather
                    than fi rstnarne (this is referred
                    to as camel case). You can also
                    use an underscore between each
                    word (you cannot use a dash).
