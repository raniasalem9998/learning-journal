        <head><h1>WHAT ARE COPUTERS</h1></head>

<main>
<h2>IT IS</h2>
they are everywhere! 
<ol>
    <li>it helps ud with the thinking work</li>
    <li>performs 4 tasks:
        <ol>
            <li>input:what you tell the computer to do</li>
            <li>storage:store info.</li>
            <li>process: minipulate using arguthems</li>
            <li>output:translate to physical world!</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>DATA AND BINARY</h2>
it works with bunary (01) but not directley. any data can be stored as series of zero or one! 
<br/>
numbers and leters are strait forword.
</br>
images are made of pixels with each one presenting a colour in rgb.
</br>
sound is represented as a wave funtion with every value holding a number.
<h2>CIRCUITS AND LOGIC</h2>
the input transfer info into the computer as binary values then the cpu will combine them using tons of electic 
circuits to modify then its ready to go for the outpu.

circuits can be more complicated like add circuit.

</br>
circuits became micro and faster.why?
</br>
on top of beiing travled in speed of light, electric signals travel much less distances.
<h2> INPUT,MEMORY,CPU AND OUTPUT
</h2>
<ol>
    <li> input: keybord,touch pad,speaker.. .</li>
   <li>CPU:central processing unit,convert the info into binary and it requests 
       instructions from the memory to process then store it in memory back.
   </li>
   <li>memory:stores info</li>
   <li>output: it translates back the info to the physical form to represent it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HARDWARE , SOFTWARE</h2>
when you look inside the computer youll see the hardware but what you dont see like binary numbers are called 
software.
</br>
the cpu connects both of them and some programs like <strong>OS</strong> can inable the 
computer to do muli tasks by switching between them fast!
