                <h2> CH8-Extra markup </h2>
                vertions of HTML are developed over the years to improve the featchers. the first one was
                back in 1997.(HTML4), all his commands are those we know plus some appearence
                options that are now not favorable to use.then came (XHTML1.0) in 2000 to follow the rules of XML stated
                to be:
                <ol>
                    <li> Every element needed a
                        closing tag (except for empty
                        elements such as <img />).</li>
                    <li> Attribute names had to be in
                        lowercase.</li>
                    <li>All attributes required a value,
                        and all values were to be
                        placed in double quotes.</li>
                    <li> Deprecated elements should
                        no longer be used.</li>
                    <li>Every element that was
                        opened inside another
                        element should be closed
                        inside that same element.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                for HTML5
                you shoud always start your worl with
                <!doctype type> to let the browser know
                what version of HTML you are using. part your work using head header body and footer.
